# Image-Compression

I’m currently making an image compression tool. I want to make my own “.samuel” files that can store images in a more compact way. I chose this as my project as it combines an interest of mine in image processing and can get kind of complex so that I can practice with making a larger project the multiple interdependent parts. I want to start simple and that slowly build towards more complex compression strategies. 

The rough idea is that it takes in an image and transforms it to a new domain (like a Fourier domain). In this new domain the image only has few important values, so we can though away the rest and save what is important. Afterwards we can decode and transform the image back to a state close to the original. This is the same principle as .jpeg is based on. (nice video If you are interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0me3guauqOU)  

Other then playing around with compression, my goals for this project are to make sure get some practice with testing and designing my code in a nice way  

Goals: 

C++ 

OO design  

Unit Testing  

(graphical/command linen)Interface
